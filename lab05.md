## Wokring With Orginizational Units
To create an OU you can use thhe Active Directory and Computers program through our server manager. This is a GUI tat allows authorized users to create, move, and change OU's and other things. To add an OU thriugh this service you can simply righgt click the side folder area and click new Organzational Unit. This works on our `mgmnt01` box but were tasked to complete this through powershell on `ad01`.
