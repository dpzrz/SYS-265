# Lab 03: Git and Linux SSH Script


## Part 1

### Using Git on Docker


Github is what we've been using fro all out tech journals and documentation for CNCS classes. Were utilizing git fro this lab to allow our user to `push` `pull` `clone` and `commit`.


Were first tasked with loading a whole git repositorty made specifically for this lab. For me this repisisotory is named tech-journal-private. Using the git `clone` command we can copy over the entirety of the repo onto our docker machine. 

We create a folder structure for the later portions for this lab. We run through the commands `git add` `git status`.

We have to configure our email and username with git and this is done by the below commands.

* git config user.name _insert username here_
* git config user.email _insert email here_

The `git commit` command trails the repo configs. It commits the changes to the repo.

### Using Git on Windows
